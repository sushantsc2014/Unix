#### Creating GROUPS ####

We can add group entry manuually in '/etc/group' file OR use 'groupadd' command

[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ sudo groupadd -g 777 group_1
[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ grep group_1 /etc/group
group_1:x:777:

-- Option 'g' is not mandatory. If not specified, group ID will automatically created. If explicitaly specified, will create with mentioned group ID.

#### Modifying GROUPS ####

1. To change group name

[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ sudo groupmod -n group1 group_1
[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ grep group1 /etc/group
group1:x:777:

groupmod -n <new_name> <old_name>

	Changing group name won't have any effect. As everything is owned by GROUP ID and USER ID, not by GROUP NAME and USER NAME.

2. To chnage group ID

I have one file, and it it group owned by GROUP1 (777)

[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ ls -lrt /tmp/jackpot/imp.txt 
-rw-rw-r--. 1 sushantsc2014 group1 0 Nov  5 10:46 /tmp/jackpot/imp.txt

Now I'll change GROUP ID for group GROUP1

[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ sudo groupmod -g 888 group1
[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ grep group1 /etc/group
group1:x:888:


[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ ls -lrt /tmp/jackpot/imp.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 sushantsc2014 777 0 Nov  5 10:46 /tmp/jackpot/imp.txt

Now, when we changed GROUP ID, file imp.txt which was OWNED by 777 (GROUP1) , but we changed groupid of GROUP1 to 888. So file imp.txt is now owned by 777 group ID.

3. To delete group

[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ groupdel group1
-bash: /usr/sbin/groupdel: Permission denied
[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ sudo groupdel group1

[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$ grep group1 /etc/group
[sushantsc2014@unix-box ~]$
