Files/directories are owned by User ID and Group ID, not by username and groupname.

1) READ permission (r)
	a. On file- allows user/processes to ready content of file. Can be viewed and copied.
	b. On directory- file names can be listed in directory (only 'ls'  command. 'ls -l' won't work if directory have only read perission)
	
2) WRITE permission (w)
	a. On file- content can be written in file and saved.
	b. On directory- Files can be added, removed from directory. But it will also require 'execute' permisiion on directory
	
3) EXECUTE permission (x)
	a. On file- file can be executed or run as process 
	b. On directory- User can use 'cd' command, use directory in 'path', to get into directory.
	

* IMPORTANT- The permissions of all parent directories must be considered before considering the permissions on a specific file.

$ls -l abc.txt

-rwxrwxrwx abc.txt

*****Symbilic method

u: user, g: group, o: other, a: all
r: read, w: write, x: execute
+: add, -: remove, =: set to

chmod u+x abc.txt  --> add exceute permission for user
chmod go+x abc.txt --> add execute permission for group and others
chmod a+rx abc.txt --> add read, execute permission to all
chmod u+x,g-x,o-rw abc.txt --> add x permisison to Uer, removes x permission from group, removes read, write permission from others
chmod a-x --> removes execute permission from all
chmod a=rw abc.txt  --> overwrites permisisons and set all permisions to read and write for all

*****Numeric method

********DEFAULT Permissions*******

$umask

this command will give you umask value. When you subtract this value from maximum allowable default permision, you get DEFAULT PERMISSIONS on file, directory.

MAXIMUM DEFAULT PERMISSIONS
 On directory- 777 (rwx rwx rwx)
 On file- 666 (rw- rw- rw-)
 
Example-
$umask
0022
 
Default directory permission 777-022 : 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
Default file permission 666-022 : 644 (rw-r--r--)
