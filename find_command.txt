------------------------------------------
Modified time VS Change time VS Access time

When content of file is changed : Modified timestamp will get updated
When permissions on file, user/group of file changes or content of file changed : Change timestamp will get updated
When you see the content of file or suppose, fiel is accessed by other (like autosys to call script), you execute a .sh file : Access timestamp will get changed

If you edit the file--> modified time and access time will changed
If I change permissions or user/group--> Only change time will changed
If I 'cat' the file or go in command mode of 'VI' or I execute .sh file--> Access time will get updated

'touch' command will update all the three timestamp
